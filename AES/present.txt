p.8 
We have an assumption in the program, we assume that Eve knows a certain vocabulary in the plaintext.​

For example, COMP4334 is a good subject, COMP4334 or is or good these we need to know one of the word​

The program will compile the correct key based on the vocabulary



P.9
The AES-128 encryption has a 128-bit or 16-byte long key used for encryption and later decryption.​

To save the time, we assume we already know 12 bytes, so only 4 bytes are left to guess.
The key we set is random. Normally, it can be done in an hour or less.
​
These are our codes, where we restrict the search to only the last 2 bytes,
 because the program may have run-time errors that take too long.

P. 10
In AES program, if Eve knows the first vocabulary of the plaintext, the program will effectively crack the complete plaintext.
But if Eve knows the second vocabulary in plaintext, 
the program will take a lot of time, because it is difficult to use the known second vocabulary to decrypt the first vocabulary,
 it will take at least 1 hour to decrypt.


P. 11
The AES encrypts require more calculations power and are more difficult to implement. 
AES is a suitable encryption method if Alice and Bob have enough time. 
Each block of AES is encrypted in the same way. 
At the same time, AES encryption can compress any plaintext size to a fixed size.
 It also uses an algebraic structure, which can effectively avoid attacks. AES also uses RSA for key distribution.
